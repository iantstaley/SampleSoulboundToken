# SampleSoulboundToken
A sample Solidity contract code that demonstrates how to create a simple soulbound token.
This contract creates a token called "Soulbound Token" with the symbol "SBT". The soulbound mapping keeps track of whether an address is marked as a soulbound address or not. The transfer, approve, and transferFrom functions all check if the tokens are soulbound before allowing a transfer to occur. The setSoulbound function can be used to set or unset the soulbound status of an address.
